### Logistics
The code is written in Python 3.
You must be in the tensor flow environment in order to run this code. Assuming tensor flow has been enabled on your machine, you can enter the environment from terminal with:

'''source activate tensor'''

The code requires the following packages to run: 

You can easily install these via the command line using pip. For example

```pip install numpy```

After (one time) installations and the repo downloaded, you should be good to go.

### Current Results
To reproduce the current results of this work, observe (and if you are so inclined, run) the following jupyter notebooks:
